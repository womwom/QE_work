     Parallel version (MPI), running on     4 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       4
     1747 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./YBCO6/YBCO6.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PZ
                           (   1   1   0   0   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
